Step 1: Login Page and Component
================================

This step is worth a total of 10 points.

##Requirements

 1. Checkout the `steps/01_login` branch

 2. Using `SignUpPage.jsx` as an example, create a `LoginPage.jsx` that POSTs to `/auth/login`

 3. Using `SignUpForm.jsx` as an example, create a `LoginForm.jsx` component
    - your form should have two fields:
        1. A regular `TextField[name="email"]`
        2. A password `TextField[name="password"]`

 4. Make sure you add the appropriate route for your new login page, and update both `HomePage.jsx` and `Base.jsx` to feature the new page's link.

 5. Make as many commits as you want, but commit your completed work using the message template: `"[#01 complete] <your commit message>"`
